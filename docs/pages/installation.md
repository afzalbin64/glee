## Glee Installation

Before installing Glee into your project, make sure you have pre-installed [AsyncAPI CLI](https://github.com/asyncapi/cli) tool.

The best way to get started with Glee is by using AsyncAPI CLI, which sets up everything automatically for you. 
To create a project, run:
```sh
asyncapi new glee
```
