[Glee](https://github.com/asyncapi/glee) is a spec-first framework that helps you build server-side applications. It leverages the AsyncAPI specification to make you more productive:

- Glee operates on the principle of defining the API specification (AsyncAPI) before diving into the actual implementation of the application logic.
- Glee ensures your code and AsyncAPI definition are on par, eliminating the problem of outdated documentation. Glee takes care of this automatically for you.
- Glee lets you focus on what matters and handles the rest for you. You only write the code for your business use-case. Glee takes care of performance, scalability, resilience, and everything you need to make your application production-ready.
